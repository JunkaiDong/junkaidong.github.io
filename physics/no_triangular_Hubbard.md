## No Solid State Triangular Lattice Hubbard Model?

This is a record of what Ashvin taught me during cookie time one day: why is it so hard to get triangular lattice models in solid state systems.

Assume that there is already a two-dimensional atomic triangular lattice, particularly with $C_3$ symmetry. Note that Hubbard models usually arise out of $d-$wave orbitals: $s$-orbitals are too close to the nucleus that the hopping $t$ is too small (not sure what happens with $p$ orbitals). To get a clean Hubbard model one can only have one orbital per atom. This means that we should study the singlet representations of $C_3$ consisting of $d$-orbitals. Now:

- $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ form a two-dimensional irrep of $C_3$.

- $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{xy}$ form a two-dimensional irrep of $C_3$.

- $d_{2z^2-x^2-y^2}$ is a singlet under $C_3$; however, its orbital shape is such that it does not have a large in-plane hopping $t$. This means that we also cannot construct a Hubbard model with these orbitals.

Hence we are not able to construct triangular lattice Hubbard models atomically. $C_4$ evades this problem: $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{xy}$ are singlets under $C_4$.
