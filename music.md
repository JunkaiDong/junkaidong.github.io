## Music

I play three kinds of instruments: piano, pipe organ, and [Guqin (古琴)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin). I have recorded videos of myself playing: they can be found on my [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/441831401) account.

### Piano

I started playing the piano at a young age, but I almost completely gave it up when I was 14. I'm glad to have picked it up again at Cornell with Prof. Miri Yampolski.

### Pipe Organ

I am lucky to have been introduced to the organ by Prof. Annette Richards and Prof. David Yearsley at Cornell University. There, I began my organ career on the [Anabel Taylor organ](https://historicalkeyboards.as.cornell.edu/baroque-organ) under the instruction of Prof. Richards and I gave my first recital there with several other students. After coming to Harvard, I study with Prof. Peter Sykes. I am heavily involved with organs at Harvard and the Harvard Organ Society. I'm also the recital coordinator for the [Busch Midday Recital Series](https://www.facebook.com/harvardorgansociety/) and I have been lucky to perform my [first personal recital](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsLWIlLmx2E&ab_channel=JunkaiDong) in [Busch Hall](http://mypipeorganhobby.blogspot.com/2008/12/organ-harvard-u-edward-power-biggs.html).

### Guqin (古琴)

Guqin is a plucked seven-string instrument. I started learning Guqin from Mr. Rong Li when I was thirteen. As its scores only contain fingerings without a lot of phrasing or rhythmic interpretations, players are required to use their own judgements. I have done some research and did my best to interpret two pieces, [潇湘水云](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Lo4y1d7e1) and [短清](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1XS4y1j7xy). I have recently been invited to give a lecture on Guqin tablature at the New England Conservatory; the slides can be found [here](/assets/Guqin_Tablature_submit.pdf).
